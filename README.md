# X++ Programming Language

This is a systems programming language designed for performance and safety. It is built off the 
now-legacy [X Programming Language](https://github.com/joshuawills/X-Compiler) but built directly
with C++ to better leverage LLVM.

The language is a mix of C and Rust syntax, taking features I like from both.
